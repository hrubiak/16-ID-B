Beamline description
====================

High-pressure x-ray diffraction in diamond anvil cells with microfocused x-ray beam. 
Two independent experimental configurations including one for in-situ laser heating 
and one for general purpose applications including low temperature He cryostat.

ID-B General Purpose Table
--------------------------

The General Purpose Table is a dedicated end-station for angle-dispersive micro-x-ray diffraction of samples in a diamond anvil cell.

Capabilities include:

* Powder, polycrystalline and single-crystal techniques
* Axial and radial geometries
* Mechanical, pneumatic, and piezoelectric pressure control
* Cryogenic cooling down to ~15 K (~4 K with large cryostat)
* Whole-cell (resistive) heating up to ~800 K
* Static and time-resolved measurements
* Online ruby and optical microscopes

Additional features and specific configuration choices include:

* Si(111), Si(220), and Ge(111) monochromator crystals with an energy range ~18-50 keV
* Large and small KB focusing assemblies for highest flux and highest spatial resolution, respectively
* Clean-up pinholes from 10-150+ microns
* Hybrid sample stack that can accommodate up to 30 kg payload with micron precision
* Beamstop with integrated photodiode
* PILATUS 1M-F detector (450-micron silicon sensor, 125 Hz imaging frequency)
* Complementary software for rapid, 2D, on-the-fly transmission and/or x-ray diffraction imaging
* Flexible end-station design to accommodate special experimental configurations

ID-B Laser Heating Table
------------------------

The Laser Heating table is equipped with a double-sided infrared laser 
heating system integrated with ID-Bâ€™s monochromatic micro X-ray diffraction 
capability for studying structure properties of polycrystalline, single 
crystal, and amorphous materials under simultaneous ultra-high PT conditions.  
The system offers (1) tunable laser heating spot sizes ranging from 4 to > 
60 microns in flat-top area of the laser intensity profile (FWHM 9 to > 
120 microns) with two identical IPG YLR-100-1064-WC fiber lasers operating 
in continuous-wave mode or in modulation mode, and (2) simultaneous 
temperature measurements from a 4-micron area in the center of the 
heating spot from both sides of the heated sample with an Acton SpectroPro 
SP2560 imaging spectrograph equipped with two area detectors: a back-illuminated 
CCD detector (PIXIS 400BR, Princeton Instruments) and a em-ICCD detector 
(PI-MAX4, Princeton Instruments).  With a mirror-pinhole setup at the entrance 
of the spectrograph, experimenters can observe where the temperature is actually
measured relative to the heated spot for precise alignment of the temperature 
sampling area with the center of the heating spot and X-ray beam to ensure 
experiment data quality.  Incident X-ray beam is typically focused to 6 X 5 
micron in FWHM with a 320 X 320 mm KB or to 2 X 1 microns with a 200 X 100 mm 
KB, and is spatially filtered through a clean-up pinhole to remove tailing 
radiation intensity before reaching the sample position.  The X-ray diffraction 
data of polycrystalline, single crystal and amorphous materials are recorded 
with a Pilatus 1Mf detector.  Supporting equipment includes online ruby and 
Raman systems, membrane remote pressure control.  Laser heating table can be 
operated in remote mode, if needed.

Recent additions (2017): 

(1)  X-ray focus 2 X 1 micron (FWHM) with 200 X 100 mm KB

(2)  2D XRD imaging
