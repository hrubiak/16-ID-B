Sample preparation for high-pressure laser heating
=====================

In a laser-heated DAC, a sample is heated by absorbing the IR laser radiation (1064 nm).  If a sample is completely transparent or opaque to this radiation, heating will not be achieved by directing the laser beam to the sample.  Therefore, itâ€™s critical that the sample absorbs the 1064 nm radiation, or the sample is mixed with a laser absorber material (Pt black or others) if you plan to use our system with 1064 nm lasers.  Furthermore, since diamond is a superb thermal conductor, insulation layers between diamond culets and the sample are highly desired to achieve good quality heating.  In some cases, for example when the sample is metallic, the thermal insulation layers are absolutely required.  An ideal sample arrangement is as shown in the figure below.  Commonly used thermal insulation materials are NaCl, KCl, Ar, MgO, Al2O3.  When choosing an insulation material, one should consider (1) pressure and temperature range of the experiment, (2) XRD pattern of the insulation material, to minimize or eliminate overlaps with the sample, (3) potential chemical reactions between the insulation material and the sample.  Polished single crystal plates of MgO and Al2O3 have proven to be more effective thermal insulation layers than the pressed polycrystalline plates.  If MgO powder is to be used, freshly crushed MgO single crystal is recommended.
