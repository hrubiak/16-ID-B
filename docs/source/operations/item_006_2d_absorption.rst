2D x-ray absorption imaging
---------------------------

*  The 2D x-ray absorption imaging is carried out in scan mode and
   uses scan program Diptera (see DipteraMiniGuid for detailed
   instructions).

*  2D parameters are set in scan control, Rel. min., Rel max. and
   Points for both LH CEN Y and LH SAM Z, and count time (sec).

*  Make sure "step axis" box is checked before click start scan
   button.

*  Once a 2D absorption map is obtained, one can click any point
   on the 2D plot to get the position. The position (y, z) is
   displayed in the position control area. To move the sample
   stage motor y and z to the clicked position, press the
   horizontal axis center button. In the following example, it is
   the button with number 0.1913, and it is the center sample
   position.
